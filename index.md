I am Zhangjie Wu. I am a Ph.D. student at [Show Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/showlab/home?authuser=0), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Mike Zheng Shou](https://sites.google.com/view/showlab) and [Prof. Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/). 
I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Yixiao Ge](https://geyixiao.com/) and [Dr. Xintao Wang](https://xinntao.github.io/) at [Tencent ARC Lab](https://arc.tencent.com/).
I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Shen Yuan Honors College](http://hc.buaa.edu.cn/) of [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on AI for video understanding and generation, including [Tune-A-Video](https://tuneavideo.github.io/), [Show-1](https://showlab.github.io/Show-1/), and [MotionDirector](https://showlab.github.io/MotionDirector/).
